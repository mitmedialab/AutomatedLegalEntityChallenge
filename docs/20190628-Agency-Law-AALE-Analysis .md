#### RESTATEMENT OF THE LAW OF AGENCY (THIRD) based on Berkeley's Reader c/o MIT Media Lab Computational Law

#### June 28th 2019 - First analysis & comments inserted in italics in Law of Agency Frameworks in case Principal or Agent or Third Party are AALE/DAOs.

#

#### Methodology

##### These points will also be reminded in the take-away memo for the first Live session.

##### Step 1- The whole point of the legal analysis methodology here, is to take a certain body of Law (now, Agency Law) ; review its sections and articles ; extract a "check-list" of legal concepts and functions, that are relevant to AALE/DAOs, and in particular, that are sensitive to a duality whereas AALE/DAOs interact with traditional systems.

##### Step 2- Having done that within the framework of a particular body of Law, that check-list can be used to complement an R4 primary legal analysis, i.e. Roles & Relationships, Rights and Responsibilities.

##### Step 3- You can then move to table/matrix scenarios permutations as follows: "allocate functions to roles, and play scenarios from the perspective of each role (_Dazza summing it up_)". In particular, you can permute scenarios whereas none of the parties is an AALE/DAO, followed by more permutations whereas each of the party in turn is an AALE/DAO (_Dazza's current method_).

##### Tables/Matrix details will be upcoming.

##### This methodology may be applied to any situation under any type of Law within any jurisdictional legal framework.

## READER

### Law 253.2, Sec. 1
### Agency, Partnerships and Limited Liability Companies

### Instructor: Professor Richard M. Buxbaum
 
### Spring 2018
### UC Berkeley School of Law

#### Message from Professor Buxbaum regarding the Reader:

#### For your convenience, I have put all of the relevant provisions of the Restatement Third, Agency into the “Reader”.  Obviously, you are not assigned all of them; rather, you should have them in front of you as we march through what is the U.S. equivalent of an “Agency Code” in our first session on January 10.

#### The excerpts from texts by DeMott (incidentally, the Chief Reporter for this Restatement) and Francis are background material; the latter particularly helpful in the comparative-law context.  In that connection please recall that students from non-U.S. legal systems should have their legislation concerning “Agency” for ready reference.  Occasional looks at that material will help you contextualize the U.S. material; correspondingly, reflecting on other roads to the same universal concept will do the same for the JD students.

#


#### § 1.01 Agency Defined

Agency is the fiduciary relationship that arises when one person (a "principal") manifests assent to another person (an "agent") that the agent shall act on the principal's behalf and subject to the principal's control, and the agent manifests assent or otherwise consents so to act.

**Chris comment:**

>_Definition “manifestation of assent to another person” and “manifestation of assent or otherwise consents so to act” by AALE may have to be refined in the context of manifestations other than oral, written or what is commonly understood ad de facto action by a human that s necessary & sufficient to indicate consent._

#

#### § 1.02 Parties' Labeling and Popular Usage Not Controlling

An agency relationship arises only when the elements stated in § 1.01 are present. Whether a relationship is characterized as agency in an agreement between parties or in the context of industry or popular usage is not controlling.

**Chris comment:**

>_Need to clarify the scope of “Not Controlling” if / when / once AALE & smart contract / autonomous automated contractual processes are part and parcel of industry or popular usage._

#

#### § 1.03 Manifestation

A person manifests assent or intention through written or spoken words or other conduct.

**Chris comment:**

>_While “or other conduct” is vague enough to warrant inclusion of AALE situations, it might be useful to refine the definition of AALE non-human conduct that are necessary & sufficient to warrant “Manifestation”._

#

#### § 1.04 Terminology

(1)	Coagents. Coagents have agency relationships with the same principal. A coagent may be appointed by the principal or by another agent actually or apparently authorized by the principal to do so. 

**Chris comment:**

>_Refine for AALE meaning of “actually or apparently authorized”._

(2) Disclosed, undisclosed, and unidentified principals. 

(a) Disclosed principal. A principal is disclosed if, when an agent and a third party interact, the third party has notice that the agent is acting for a principal and has notice of the principal's identity.

(b) Undisclosed principal. A principal is undisclosed if, when an agent and a third party interact, the third party has no notice that the agent is acting for a principal.

(c) Unidentified principal. A principal is unidentified if, when an agent and a third party interact, the third party has notice that the agent is acting for a principal but does not have notice of the principal's identity. 

**Chris comment:**

>_In the AALE context, disclosed but unidentified principal may be a common situation in anonymous / pseudonymous / ring signatures situations._

(3) Gratuitous agent. A gratuitous agent acts without a right to compensation.

(4) Notice. A person has notice of a fact if the person knows the fact, has reason to know the fact, has received an effective notification of the fact, or should know the fact to fulfill a duty owed to another person. Notice of a fact that an agent knows or has reason to know is imputed to the principal as stated in §§ 5.03 and 5.04. A notification given to or by an agent is effective as notice to or by the principal as stated in § 5.02. 

**Chris comment:**

>_“Notice” could be a slippery ground in the AALE context due to the fact that it relates primarily to cognitive processes cognizant to or implicit from any traditional human or administrative organization. In other words, for any particular AALE-AALEs or AALE-human interaction, how do each party “confirm” that they agree on the fact that they agree on any particular interpretation of notice given or received. On mutual understanding, see in particular below “§ 2.02 Scope of Actual Authority”._

(5) Person. A person is (a) an individual; (b) an organization or association that has legal capacity to possess rights and incur obligations; (c) a government, political subdivision, or instrumentality or entity created by government; or (d) any other entity that has legal capacity to possess rights and incur obligations. 

**Chris comment:**

>_The following is purely intuitive: “(5) Person” might want to be taken out of “§ 1.04 Terminology“ (perhaps together with (4) Notice) and put in an introductory paragraph “Preliminary Assumptions”. As AALEs primarily falls under (d) but may overlap with (b) and (c), they may require their own category (one category to start with and keep it simple). This category may indicate minimum necessary & sufficient criteria to qualify as AALE. One clear reason to do this for both (5) Person & (4) Notice is to have a clear legal foundation for reasonable expectations and anticipations of problems in the context of autonomous / automated processes of language, cognition, notice, confirmation, validation._

(6) Power given as security. A power given as security is a power to affect the legal relations of its creator that is created in the form of a manifestation of actual authority and held for the benefit of the holder or a third person. It is given to protect a legal or equitable title or to secure the performance of a duty apart from any duties owed the holder of the power by its creator that are incident to a relationship of agency under § 1.01. 

**Chris comment:**

>_Subject to previous remarks on refining necessary & sufficient conditions (criteria) for “manifestation” in an AALE context._

(7) Power of attorney. A power of attorney is an instrument that states an agent's authority. 

**Chris comment:**

>_Subject to refinement in an AALE context including but nt limited to smart contracts._

(8) Subagent. A subagent is a person appointed by an agent to perform functions that the agent has consented to perform on behalf of the agent's principal and for whose conduct the appointing agent is responsible to the principal. The relationship between an appointing agent and a subagent is one of agency, created as stated in § 1.01. 

**Chris comment:**

>_May explore in context of human or non-AALE hiring an AALE (that manages a fleet of drones which could be hacked...)._

(9) Superior and subordinate coagents. A superior coagent has the right, conferred by the principal, to direct a subordinate coagent. 

**Chris comment:**

>_May explore in context of human or non-AALE subordinates being managed by superior AALE agent to prevent Labor Law issues & riots._

(10) Trustee and agent-trustee. A trustee is a holder of property who is subject to fiduciary duties to deal with the property for the benefit of charity or for one or more persons, at least one of whom is not the sole trustee. An agent-trustee is a trustee subject to the control of the settlor or of one or more beneficiaries. 

**Chris comment:**

>_Relevant to AALE & digital/crypto assets custodians._

#

#### § 2.01 Actual Authority

An agent acts with actual authority when, at the time of taking action that has legal consequences for the principal, the agent reasonably believes, in accordance with the principal's manifestations to the agent, that the principal wishes the agent so to act. 

**Chris comment:**

>_Relevant to the definition of “manifestation”, “belief”, and related cognitive, communication, validation and confirmation processes in the context of AALE-human and AALE-AALE interactions._

#

#### § 2.02 Scope of Actual Authority

(1) An agent has actual authority to take action designated or implied in the principal's manifestations to the agent and acts necessary or incidental to achieving the principal's objectives, as the agent reasonably understands the principal's manifestations and objectives when the agent determines how to act. 

**Chris comment:**

>_Need to refine the formalization and codification of “reasonable understanding” by an AALE agent and what that implies for the formalization and codification of the principal's manifestations and objectives when the principal is either a non-AALE or an AALE._

(2) An agent's interpretation of the principal's manifestations is reasonable if it reflects any meaning known by the agent to be ascribed by the principal and, in the absence of any meaning known to the agent, as a reasonable person in the agent's position would interpret the manifestations in light of the context, including circumstances of which the agent has notice and the agent's fiduciary duty to the principal. 

**Chris comment:**

>_If a “reasonable (human / organization) person’s interpretation” is to be taken as benchmark, then it further implies such criteria to be formalized and codified at minima as part of the AALE agent’s cognitive process. Same for the translation, formalization and codification of the AALE agent’s fiduciary duties._

(3) An agent's understanding of the principal's objectives is reasonable if it accords with the principal's manifestations and the inferences that a reasonable person in the agent's position would draw from the circumstances creating the agency. 

**Chris comment:**

>_On “mutual understanding” see remarks in “§ 1.04 Terminology (4) Notice”._

#

#### § 2.03 Apparent Authority

Apparent authority is the power held by an agent or other actor to affect a principal's legal relations with third parties when a third party reasonably believes the actor has authority to act on behalf of the principal and that belief is traceable to the principal's manifestations. 

**Chris comment:**

>_Since the belief by the third party must be traceable to the principal’s manifestations, then this plugs back to refining definition of such “believable manifestations” when the principal is an AALE. When the principal is an AALE, then this AALE’s manifestations have to be formalized in a way that is understandable and believable by a non-AALE third party (there could be direct implication on triggering Estoppel in favor of principal or not). When both principal and third party are AALEs, then we might want to be mindful of how much minimum common language in formalization and coding is necessary between them to minimize problematic ambiguities._

#

#### § 2.04 Respondeat Superior

An employer is subject to liability for torts committed by employees while acting within the scope of their employment. 

**Chris comment:**

>_This could be in particular examined both ways: when employer is an AALE and (some of) the employees are humans ; or when the employer is human and (some of) the employees are AALEs – that utilize fleets of drones which could be hacked for ex._

#

#### § 2.05 Estoppel to Deny Existence of Agency Relationship

A person who has not made a manifestation that an actor has authority as an agent and who is not otherwise liable as a party to a transaction purportedly done by the actor on that person's account is subject to liability to a third party who justifiably is induced to make a detrimental change in position because the transaction is believed to be on the person's account, if

(1) the person intentionally or carelessly caused such belief, or (see below (2)) 

**Chris comment:**

>_If the person is an AALE, it’s hard to see how it can prevent such a situation from arising: could tons of disclaimers and a rigorous early registration process of third party that invalidates non-authorized agents even be sufficient?_

(2) having notice of such belief and that it might induce others to change their positions, the person did not take reasonable steps to notify them of the facts. 

**Chris comment:**

>_If the person is an AALE, then again this shows the dire need of formalizing and coding the cognitive and communication act of “notice” of that particular situation, and the necessary devices to “notify” third parties of the facts, in ways indeed intelligible to third parties under conditions defined as “notice”._

#

#### § 2.06 Liability of Undisclosed Principal

(1) An undisclosed principal is subject to liability to a third party who is justifiably induced to make a detrimental change in position by an agent acting on the principal's behalf and without actual authority if the principal, having notice of the agent's conduct and that it might induce others to change their positions, did not take reasonable steps to notify them of the facts. 

**Chris comment:**

>_The fact that the principal is undisclosed may not have particular incidence or relevance when this undisclosed principal is also an AALE. Other than that, same remarks on cognitive, communication and “notice” process when principal is AALE. When agent is AALE, the onus is on the undisclosed principal to due proper due diligence on AALE processes before hiring – which again suggests notions of formalization, coding and industry standards._

(2) An undisclosed principal may not rely on instructions given an agent that qualify or reduce the agent's authority to less than the authority a third party would reasonably believe the agent to have under the same circumstances if the principal had been disclosed. 

**Chris comment:**

>_Same remark as (1)._

#

#### § 2.07 Restitution of Benefit

If a principal is unjustly enriched at the expense of another person by the action of an agent or a person who appears to be an agent, the principal is subject to a claim for restitution by that person. 

**Chris comment:**

>_If principal is an AALE it should have proper mechanisms to deal with such claims._

#

#### § 3.01 Creation of Actual Authority

Actual authority, as defined in § 2.01, is created by a principal's manifestation to an agent that, as reasonably understood by the agent, expresses the principal's assent that the agent take action on the principal's behalf. 

**Chris comment:**

>_Same remarks on “manifestation” when principal and/or agent are AALEs._

#

#### § 3.02 Formal Requirements

If the law requires a writing or record signed by the principal to evidence an agent's authority to bind a principal to a contract or other transaction, the principal is not bound in the absence of such a writing or record. A principal may be estopped to assert the lack of such a writing or record when a third party has been induced to make a detrimental change in position by the reasonable belief that an agent has authority to bind the principal that is traceable to a manifestation made by the principal. 

**Chris comment:**

>_Perhaps Agency Law may not be sufficient to cover, also in the context of AALEs, implications for contract law, property law, etc, and consequences on, for ex., mechanisms to warrant supply chain integrity, such as: certificates of origin, of conformity, of quality, bill of lading, shipment tracking, etc. How to implement supply chain integrity components with AALEs at principal and/or agent and/or third-party level, etc, when some or all of these components are themselves operating in autonomous / automated fashion. Furthermore, there is a fundamental question here for Contract Law: when one or several among Principal – Agent – Third Party are AALE(s), what becomes of the technical definition of a “contract” when all or some of these AALE(s) parties are signatories, next to human or administrative “persons”. **Is “contract” just a piece of paper or does it require to be encoded or at least have an encoded twin, in which case, what is the legal status of this encoded doppelganger, what are referents for both legal and technical enforcement (pretty basic question)**._

#

#### § 3.03 Creation of Apparent Authority

Apparent authority, as defined in § 2.03, is created by a person's manifestation that another has authority to act with legal consequences for the person who makes the manifestation, when a third party reasonably believes the actor to be authorized and the belief is traceable to the manifestation. 

**Chris comment:**

>_Same remarks as before on “§ 2.03 apparent authority”._

#

#### § 3.04 Capacity to Act as Principal

(1) An individual has capacity to act as principal in a relationship of agency as defined in § 1.01 if, at the time the agent takes action, the individual would have capacity if acting in person. 

**Chris comment:**

>_An individual is not an AALE._

(2) The law applicable to a person that is not an individual governs whether the person has capacity to be a principal in a relationship of agency as defined in § 1.01, as well as the effect of the person's lack or loss of capacity on those who interact with it. 

**Chris comment:**

>_Then how do we define / refine the capacity of an AALE to act as a Principal?_

(3) If performance of an act is not delegable, its performance by an agent does not constitute performance by the principal. 

**Chris comment:**

>_In Present / Future of Work corporate or community frictions or conflicts, we might want to ask whether there could be any situations of: AALE agent intervening in context on non-delegable performance by non-AALE principal ; or of non-AALE agent intervening in context of non-delegable performance by non-AALE principal._

#

#### § 3.05 Capacity to Act as Agent

Any person may ordinarily be empowered to act so as to affect the legal relations of another. The actor's capacity governs the extent to which, by so acting, the actor becomes subject to duties and liabilities to the person whose legal relations are affected or to third parties. 

**Chris comment:**

>_Then how do we define / refine the capacity of an AALE to act as an Agent?_

#

#### § 3.06 Termination of Actual Authority--In General

An agent's actual authority may be terminated by: 

**Chris comment:**

>_(conditions may be reviewed for specific processes, in particular their appropriate formalization for principal and/or agent as AALE)_

(1) the agent's death, cessation of existence, or suspension of powers as stated in § 3.07(1) and (3); or

(2) the principal's death, cessation of existence, or suspension of powers as stated in § 3.07(2) and (4); or

(3) the principal's loss of capacity, as stated in § 3.08(1) and (3); or

(4) an agreement between the agent and the principal or the occurrence of circumstances on the basis of which the agent should reasonably conclude that the principal no longer would assent to the agent's taking action on the principal's behalf, as stated in § 3.09; or

(5) a manifestation of revocation by the principal to the agent, or of renunciation by the agent to the principal, as stated in § 3.10(1); or

(6) the occurrence of circumstances specified by statute.

#

#### § 3.07 Death, Cessation of Existence, and Suspension of Powers

**Chris comment:**

>_(conditions may be reviewed for specific processes, in particular their appropriate formalization for principal and/or agent as AALE)_

(1) The death of an individual agent terminates the agent's actual authority.

(2) The death of an individual principal terminates the agent's actual authority. The termination is effective only when the agent has notice of the principal's death. The termination is also effective as against a third party with whom the agent deals when the third party has notice of the principal's death.

(3) When an agent that is not an individual ceases to exist or commences a process that will lead to cessation of existence or when its powers are suspended, the agent's actual authority terminates except as provided by law.

(4) When a principal that is not an individual ceases to exist or commences a process that will lead to cessation of its existence or when its powers are suspended, the agent's actual authority terminates except as provided by law.

#

#### § 3.08 Loss of Capacity

**Chris comment:**

>_(Loss of Capacity conditions may be reviewed for specific processes, in particular their appropriate formalization for principal and/or agent as AALE. A “written instrument” may be reviewed as including code, smart contracts, etc and related usages and limitations.)_

(1) An individual principal's loss of capacity to do an act terminates the agent's actual authority to do the act. The termination is effective only when the agent has notice that the principal's loss of capacity is permanent or that the principal has been adjudicated to lack capacity. The termination is also effective as against a third party with whom the agent deals when the third party has notice that the principal's loss of capacity is permanent or that the principal has been adjudicated to lack capacity.

(2) A written instrument may make an agent's actual authority effective upon a principal's loss of capacity, or confer it irrevocably regardless of such loss.

(3) If a principal that is not an individual loses capacity to do an act, its agent's actual authority to do the act is terminated.

#

#### § 3.09 Termination by Agreement or by Occurrence of Changed Circumstances

An agent's actual authority terminates (1) as agreed by the agent and the principal, subject to the provisions of § 3.10; 

or (2) upon the occurrence of circumstances on the basis of which the agent should reasonably conclude that the principal no longer would assent to the agent's taking action on the principal's behalf. 

**Chris comment:**

>_Other than (1) conditions defined in the provisions of § 3.10, “(2) upon the occurrence of circumstances on the basis of which the agent should reasonably conclude that the principal no longer would assent to the agent's taking action on the principal's behalf” plugs back to principal-agent cognitive, communication, and formalization issues in the context of AALE-AALE and AALE-human interactions._

#

#### § 3.10 Manifestation Terminating Actual Authority

(1) Notwithstanding any agreement between principal and agent, an agent's actual authority terminates if the agent renounces it by a manifestation to the principal or if the principal revokes the agent's actual authority by a manifestation to the agent. A revocation or a renunciation is effective when the other party has notice of it. 

**Chris comment:**

>_Same remarks on manifestation, notice and mutual understanding in an AALE context._

(2) A principal's manifestation of revocation is, unless otherwise agreed, ineffective to terminate a power given as security or to terminate a proxy to vote securities or other membership or ownership interests that is made irrevocable in compliance with applicable legislation. 

**Chris comment:**

>_See §§ 3.12-3.13. See §§ 3.12-3.13 and power given as security and proxy to vote securities or other membership or ownership interests that is made irrevocable in compliance with applicable legislation, etc, in an AALE & digital assets context, as legislation is evolving._

#

#### § 3.11 Termination of Apparent Authority

(1) The termination of actual authority does not by itself end any apparent authority held by an agent.

(2) Apparent authority ends when it is no longer reasonable for the third party with whom an agent deals to believe that the agent continues to act with actual authority. 

**Chris comment:**

>_Again need to specify conditions of “reasonable belief” by third party of authority in AALE context._

#

#### § 3.12 Power Given as Security; Irrevocable Proxy

**Chris comment:**

>_See power given as security and proxy to vote securities or other membership or ownership interests that is made irrevocable in compliance with applicable legislation, etc, in an AALE & digital assets context, as legislation is evolving._

(1) A power given as security is a power to affect the legal relations of its creator that is created in the form of a manifestation of actual authority and held for the benefit of the holder or a third person. This power is given to protect a legal or equitable title or to secure the performance of a duty apart from any duties owed the holder of the power by its creator that are incident to a relationship of agency under § 1.01. It is given upon the creation of the duty or title or for consideration. It is distinct from actual authority that the holder may exercise if the holder is an agent of the creator of the power.

(2) A power to exercise voting rights associated with securities or a membership interest may be conferred on a proxy through a manifestation of actual authority. The power may be given as security under (1) and may be made irrevocable in compliance with applicable legislation.

#

#### § 3.13 Termination of Power Given as Security or Irrevocable Proxy

**Chris comment:**

>_Same remark as previous 3.12._

(1) A power given as security or an irrevocable proxy is terminated by an event that

(a) discharges the obligation secured by the power or terminates the interest secured or supported by the proxy, or

(b) makes its execution illegal or impossible, or

(c) constitutes an effective surrender of the power or proxy by the person for whose benefit it was created or conferred.

(2) Unless otherwise agreed, neither a power given as security nor a proxy made irrevocable as provided in § 3.12(2) is terminated by:

(a) a manifestation revoking the power or proxy made by the person who created it; or

(b) surrender of the power or proxy by its holder if it is held for the benefit of another person, unless that person consents; or

(c) loss of capacity by the creator or the holder of the power or proxy; or

(d) death of the holder of the power or proxy, unless the holder's death terminates the interest secured or supported by the power or proxy; or

(e) death of the creator of the power or proxy, if the power or proxy is given as security for the performance of a duty that does not terminate with the death of its creator.

#

#### § 3.14 Agents with Multiple Principals

**Chris comment:**

>_3.14., 3.15., 3.16. plug back into above principal / agent problematics in AALE context._

An agent acting in the same transaction or matter on behalf of more than one principal may be one or both of the following:

(a) a subagent, as stated in § 3.15; or

(b) an agent for coprincipals, as stated in § 3.16.

#### § 3.15 Subagency

(1) A subagent is a person appointed by an agent to perform functions that the agent has consented to perform on behalf of the agent's principal and for whose conduct the appointing agent is responsible to the principal. The relationships between a subagent and the appointing agent and between the subagent and the appointing agent's principal are relationships of agency as stated in § 1.01.

(2) An agent may appoint a subagent only if the agent has actual or apparent authority to do so.

#### § 3.16 Agent for Coprincipals
Two or more persons may as coprincipals appoint an agent to act for them in the same transaction or matter.

#

#### § 5.03 Imputation of Notice of Fact to Principal

**Chris comment:**

>_The practical conditions of “imputation” may need to be streamlined when Principal and/or agent are AALEs, in particular for cognitive, communication and “notice” issues._

For purposes of determining a principal's legal relations with a third party, notice of a fact that an agent knows or has reason to know is imputed to the principal if knowledge of the fact is material to the agent's duties to the principal, unless the agent

(a) acts adversely to the principal as stated in § 5.04, or

(b) is subject to a duty to another not to disclose the fact to the principal.

**Chris comment:**

>_**See significantly useful Dazza's 2014 work on OPEN NOTICE Project, thae needs to be revived in this AALE context.**_

#

#### § 5.04 An Agent Who Acts Adversely to a Principal

**Chris comment:**

>_We may anticipate situations where (human) Agent acts adversely to AALE Principal (friction or conflict), or, AALE Agent deals adversely to (human) Principal, either deliberately by wicked governance or by process automatization bug or because it has been hacked._

For purposes of determining a principal's legal relations with a third party, notice of a fact that an agent knows or has reason to know is not imputed to the principal if the agent acts adversely to the principal in a transaction or matter, intending to act solely for the agent's own purposes or those of another person. Nevertheless, notice is imputed

(a) when necessary to protect the rights of a third party who dealt with the principal in good faith; or

(b) when the principal has ratified or knowingly retained a benefit from the agent's action.

A third party who deals with a principal through an agent, knowing or having reason to know that the agent acts adversely to the principal, does not deal in good faith for this purpose. 

**Chris comment:**

>_On this particular aspect “A third party who deals with a principal through an agent, knowing or having reason to know that the agent acts adversely to the principal, does not deal in good faith for this purpose. “ we may need refinement of conditions if third party is itself an AALE._

#

#### § 6.01 Agent for Disclosed Principal

When an agent acting with actual or apparent authority makes a contract on behalf of a disclosed principal,

(1) the principal and the third party are parties to the contract; and

(2) the agent is not a party to the contract unless the agent and third party agree otherwise.

**Chris comment:**

>_Same remarks on agreeing to agree on and confirm mutual understanding in AALE context._

#

#### § 6.02 Agent for Unidentified Principal

When an agent acting with actual or apparent authority makes a contract on behalf of an unidentified principal,

(1) the principal and the third party are parties to the contract; and

(2) the agent is a party to the contract unless the agent and the third party agree otherwise.

**Chris comment:**

>_In case of disclosed but unidentified AALE Principal in anonymous or pseudonymous context – using ring signatures, etc, how does it work for the third party that such Principal is a co-party to the contract ; why and how the (human) Agent would want to stay in, or out, of it?_

#

#### § 6.03 Agent for Undisclosed Principal

**Chris comment:**

>_When the Principal is undisclosed, for this Principal to be an AALE doesn’t seem to affect this clause in principle. Question is, might this affect it in practical implementation conditions as seen above, starting with technical definition of what a “contract” is when an undisclosed AALE Principal is one of the parties, but not a signatory since undisclosed. If other parties are non-AALE, may contract just be paper (see previous clause “§ 3.02 Formal Requirements”)._

When an agent acting with actual authority makes a contract on behalf of an undisclosed principal,

(1) unless excluded by the contract, the principal is a party to the contract;

(2) the agent and the third party are parties to the contract; and

(3) the principal, if a party to the contract, and the third party have the same rights, liabilities, and defenses against each other as if the principal made the contract personally, subject to §§ 6.05-6.09.

#### § 6.04 Principal Does Not Exist or Lacks Capacity

Unless the third party agrees otherwise, a person who makes a contract with a third party purportedly as an agent on behalf of a principal becomes a party to the contract if the purported agent knows or has reason to know that the purported principal does not exist or lacks capacity to be a party to a contract. 

**Chris comment:**

#### § 6.05 Contract That Is Unauthorized in Part or That Combines Orders of Several Principals

(1) If an agent makes a contract with a third party that differs from the contract that the agent had actual or apparent authority to make only in an amount or by the inclusion or exclusion of a separable part, the principal is subject to liability to the third party to the extent of the contract that the agent had actual or apparent authority to make if 

**Chris comment:**

>_Might be relevant to situations whereas a non-AALE Agent may deviate from its AALE Principal, or, inversely, the AALE Agent is badly engineered in a way that results in such unauthorized deviation._

(a) the third party seasonably makes a manifestation to the principal of willingness to be bound; and

(b) the principal has not changed position in reasonable reliance on the belief that no contract bound the principal and the third party.

(2) Two or more principals may authorize the same agent to make separate contracts for them. If the agent makes a single contract with a third party on the principals' behalves that combines the principals' separate orders or interests and calls for a single performance by the third party, 

**Chris comment:**

>_Might be relevant to cases where either one or more of the several Principals are AALE(s) mixed up with non-AALE in dealing with this Agent ; or, the Agent is an AALE badly engineered in ways that result in this contractual confusion or unauthorized conflagration._

(a) if the agent purports to make the combined contract on behalf of disclosed principals, the agent is subject to liability to the third party for breach of the agent's warranty of authority as stated in § 6.10, unless the separate principals are bound by the combined contract;

(b) if the principals are unidentified or undisclosed, the third party and the agent are the only parties to the combined contract; and

(c) unless the agent acted with actual or apparent authority to bind each of the principals to the combined contract,

(i) subject to (1), none of the separate principals is subject to liability on the combined contract; and

(ii) the third party is not subject to liability on the combined contract to any of the separate principals.

#### § 6.06 Setoff

**Chris comment:**

>_Some questions are to which extent “(non-)set off” conditions may and should be formalized & if appropriate encoded, when one or several parties are AALEs, in ways that are compliant yet reversible in case some issues arise. Or at least manageable in ways that don’t even further complicate everything when it doesn’t have to be that complicated in the first place._

(1) When an agent makes a contract on behalf of a disclosed or unidentified principal, unless the principal and the third party agree otherwise,

(a) the third party may not set off any amount that the agent independently owes the third party against an amount the third party owes the principal under the contract; and

(b) the principal may not set off any amount that the third party independently owes the agent against an amount the principal owes the third party under the contract.

(2) When an agent makes a contract on behalf of an undisclosed principal,

(a) the third party may set off

(i) any amount that the agent independently owed the third party at the time the agent made the contract and

(ii) any amount that the agent thereafter independently comes to owe the third party until the third party has notice that the agent acts on behalf of a principal against an amount the third party owes the principal under the contract;

(b) after the third party has notice that the agent acts on behalf of a principal, the third party may not set off any amount that the agent thereafter independently comes to owe the third party against an amount the third party owes the principal under the contract unless the principal consents; and

(c) the principal may not set off any amount that the third party independently owes the agent against an amount that the principal owes the third party under the contract, unless the principal and the third party agree otherwise.

(3) Unless otherwise agreed, an agent who is a party to a contract may not set off any amount that the principal independently owes the agent against an amount that the agent owes the third party under the contract. However, with the principal's consent, the agent may set off any amount that the principal could set off against an amount that the principal owes the third party under the contract.

#### § 6.07 Settlement with Agent by Principal or Third Party

**Chris comment:**

>_This plugs back into previous remarks when notions such as “manifestation”, “reasonable belief” or “reliance”, honest or mis-“representation”, etc are introduced in an AALE context. But also to the extent to which certain settlement procedures may be formalized and encoded for automation & autonomous execution – which might be both a source of safety or problems._

(1) A principal's payment to or settlement of accounts with an agent discharges the principal's liability to a third party with whom the agent has made a contract on the principal's behalf only when the principal acts in reasonable reliance on a manifestation by the third party, not induced by misrepresentation by the agent, that the agent has settled the account with the third party.

(2) A third party's payment to or settlement of accounts with an agent discharges the third party's liability to the principal if the agent acts with actual or apparent authority in accepting the payment or settlement.

(3) When an agent has made a contract on behalf of an undisclosed principal,

(a) until the third party has notice of the principal's existence, the third party's payment to or settlement of accounts with the agent discharges the third party's liability to the principal;

(b) after the third party has notice of the principal's existence, the third party's payment to or settlement of accounts with the agent discharges the third party's liability to the principal if the agent acts with actual or apparent authority in accepting the payment or settlement; and

(c) after receiving notice of the principal's existence, the third party may demand reasonable proof of the principal's identity and relationship to the agent. Until such proof is received, the third party's payment to or settlement of accounts in good faith with the agent discharges the third party's liability to the principal.

#

#### § 6.08 Other Subsequent Dealings Between Third Party and Agent

**Chris comment:**

>_In a context of AALEs, this may be relevant to situations when the autonomous and automated nature of one or several of the parties is a root cause for “subsequent dealings” dynamics, and therefore suggests caution, dealing with the unintended consequences of AALEs in the mix._

(1) When an agent has made a contract with a third party on behalf of a disclosed or unidentified principal, subsequent dealings between the agent and the third party may increase or diminish the principal's rights or liabilities to the third party if the agent acts with actual or apparent authority or the principal ratifies the agent's action.

(2) When an agent has made a contract with a third party on behalf of an undisclosed principal,

(a) until the third party has notice of the principal's existence, subsequent dealings between the third party and the agent may increase or diminish the rights or liabilities of the principal to the third party if the agent acts with actual authority, or the principal ratifies the agent's action; and

(b) after the third party has notice of the principal's existence, subsequent dealings between the third party and the agent may increase or diminish the principal's rights or liabilities to the third party if the agent acts with actual or apparent authority or the principal ratifies the agent's action.

#### § 6.09 Effect of Judgment Against Agent or Principal

**Chris comment:**

>_While key motivations here are to build a robust AALE-based economy, scalable & taxable, that remains affordable to and manageable by the largest possible human population, it is also reasonable to anticipate a substantial rise in law suits brought against AALEs, or by AALEs administrators who consider “their” valid AALE has been wronged and/or harmed. In that sense the ethical duty of professional competence for lawyers in that field, warrant to pay particular attention to “Effect of Judgment Against AALEs Agent or Principal” beyond the scope of Agency Law._

When an agent has made a contract with a third party on behalf of a principal, unless the contract provides otherwise,
(1) the liability, if any, of the principal or the agent to the third party is not discharged if the third party obtains a judgment against the other; and

(2) the liability, if any, of the principal or the agent to the third party is discharged to the extent a judgment against the other is satisfied.

#

#### § 6.10 Agent's Implied Warranty of Authority

**Chris comment:**

>_This could be in particular relevant in a context of an AALE Agent gone “rogue” by virtue or rather vice of autonomy and automation, by making a contract, representation, or conveyance to or with a third party on behalf of another person, lacking power to bind that person – either deliberately, or by engineering bug, or having been hacked by bad actors siphoning revenues._

A person who purports to make a contract, representation, or conveyance to or with a third party on behalf of another person, lacking power to bind that person, gives an implied warranty of authority to the third party and is subject to liability to the third party for damages for loss caused by breach of that warranty, including loss of the benefit expected from performance by the principal, unless

(1) the principal or purported principal ratifies the act as stated in § 4.01; or

(2) the person who purports to make the contract, representation, or conveyance gives notice to the third party that no warranty of authority is given; or

(3) the third party knows that the person who purports to make the contract, representation, or conveyance acts without actual authority.

#

#### § 6.11 Agent's Representations

**Chris comment:**

>_In a similar vein, this could be in particular relevant in a context of an AALE Agent gone “rogue” (for whatever reason) in ways that affect the nature of its “representation” to the extent that various situations and conditions of § 6.11 Agent's Representations apply. Then again how does it pan out in Court when either AALE Agent or another party are a defendant._

(1) When an agent for a disclosed or unidentified principal makes a false representation about the agent's authority to a third party, the principal is not subject to liability unless the agent acted with actual or apparent authority in making the representation and the third party does not have notice that the agent's representation is false.

(2) A representation by an agent made incident to a contract or conveyance is attributed to a disclosed or unidentified principal as if the principal made the representation directly when the agent had actual or apparent authority to make the contract or conveyance unless the third party knew or had reason to know that the representation was untrue or that the agent acted without actual authority in making it.

(3) A representation by an agent made incident to a contract or conveyance is attributed to an undisclosed principal as if the principal made the representation directly when

(a) the agent acted with actual authority in making the representation, or

(b) the agent acted without actual authority in making the representation but had actual authority to make true representations about the same matter.

The agent's representation is not attributed to the principal when the third party knew or had reason to know it was untrue.

(4) When an agent who makes a contract or conveyance on behalf of an undisclosed principal falsely represents to the third party that the agent does not act on behalf of a principal, the third party may avoid the contract or conveyance if the principal or agent had notice that the third party would not have dealt with the principal.

#

#### § 7.01 Agent's Liability to Third Party

**Chris comment:**

>_Similar remark on AALE Agent gone “rogue”, whereas “tortious conduct” need to be defined._

An agent is subject to liability to a third party harmed by the agent's tortious conduct. Unless an applicable statute provides otherwise, an actor remains subject to liability although the actor acts as an agent or an employee, with actual or apparent authority, or within the scope of employment.

#

#### § 7.02 Duty to Principal; Duty to Third Party

**Chris comment:**

>_Similar remark on AALE Agent gone “rogue”, whereas “tort liability” may be characterized once the criteria of AALE Agent process, while it “breaches a duty that the agent owes to the third party“, have been defined and refined both in broad terms and on case by case basis._

An agent's breach of a duty owed to the principal is not an independent basis for the agent's tort liability to a third party. An agent is subject to tort liability to a third party harmed by the agent's conduct only when the agent's conduct breaches a duty that the agent owes to the third party.

#

#### § 7.03 Principal's Liability--In General

**Chris comment:**

>_In particular when Agent is an AALE, the Principal’s liability issues plug back into perhaps 3 notions: -1- mutual cognitive, communication, formalization, possible encoding process when AALE Agent liaise with other parties, -2- AALE Agent gone “rogue” for whatever reason, with appropriate characterization of “tortious conduct”& “tort” by this AALE Agent, -3- last but not least, when Principal is, say, also an AALE which in addition is disclosed but unidentified (anonymous or pseudonymous, involving ring signatures, etc), how exactly does enforcement of consequences of liability get implemented? Lest third party loses all settlements or assets._

(1) A principal is subject to direct liability to a third party harmed by an agent's conduct when

(a) as stated in § 7.04, the agent acts with actual authority or the principal ratifies the agent's conduct and

(i) the agent's conduct is tortious, or

(ii) the agent's conduct, if that of the principal, would subject the principal to tort liability; or

(b) as stated in § 7.05, the principal is negligent in selecting, supervising, or otherwise controlling the agent; or

(c) as stated in § 7.06, the principal delegates performance of a duty to use care to protect other persons or their property to an agent who fails to perform the duty.

(2) A principal is subject to vicarious liability to a third party harmed by an agent's conduct when

(a) as stated in § 7.07, the agent is an employee who commits a tort while acting within the scope of employment; or

(b) as stated in § 7.08, the agent commits a tort when acting with apparent authority in dealing with a third party on or purportedly on behalf of the principal.

#

#### § 7.04 Agent Acts with Actual Authority

**Chris comment:**

>_Similar remarks as previous clause § 7.03 Principal's Liability--In General._

A principal is subject to liability to a third party harmed by an agent's conduct when the agent's conduct is within the scope of the agent's actual authority or ratified by the principal; and

(1) the agent's conduct is tortious, or

(2) the agent's conduct, if that of the principal, would subject the principal to tort liability.

#

#### § 7.05 Principal's Negligence in Conducting Activity Through Agent; Principal's Special Relationship with Another Person

**Chris comment:**

>_Similar remarks as previous clause § 7.03 Principal's Liability--In General. In addition, “When a principal has a special relationship with another person, the principal owes that person a duty of reasonable care with regard to risks arising out of the relation“, implies the Principal and that other person should reasonably assess risks of involving an AALE Agent._

(1) A principal who conducts an activity through an agent is subject to liability for harm to a third party caused by the agent's conduct if the harm was caused by the principal's negligence in selecting, training, retaining, supervising, or otherwise controlling the agent.

(2) When a principal has a special relationship with another person, the principal owes that person a duty of reasonable care with regard to risks arising out of the relation.

#

#### § 7.06 Failure in Performance of Principal's Duty of Protection

**Chris comment:**

>_Similar remarks as previous clause § 7.03 Principal's Liability--In General._

A principal required by contract or otherwise by law to protect another cannot avoid liability by delegating performance of the duty, whether or not the delegate is an agent.

#

#### § 7.07 Employee Acting Within Scope of Employment

**Chris comment:**

>_This may be relevant to Present / Future of Work & Business situations, whereas friction and conflict may arise of involving AALEs in the mix with risks at both employer & employee level. In addition, “ (3) (b) the fact that work is performed gratuitously does not relieve a principal of liability.“ may be relevant to reasonably foreseeable situations whereas AALE Agent or even whole ecosystem performs gratuitously vs previously paid human workers, creating social resentment, and, besides rioting, attracting attention and focusing law suits against Principal._

(1) An employer is subject to vicarious liability for a tort committed by its employee acting within the scope of employment.

(2) An employee acts within the scope of employment when performing work assigned by the employer or engaging in a course of conduct subject to the employer's control. An employee's act is not within the scope of employment when it occurs within an independent course of conduct not intended by the employee to serve any purpose of the employer.

(3) For purposes of this section,

(a) an employee is an agent whose principal controls or has the right to control the manner and means of the agent's performance of work, and

(b) the fact that work is performed gratuitously does not relieve a principal of liability.

#

#### § 7.08 Agent Acts with Apparent Authority

A principal is subject to vicarious liability for a tort committed by an agent in dealing or communicating with a third party on or purportedly on behalf of the principal when actions taken by the agent with apparent authority constitute the tort or enable the agent to conceal its commission. 

**Chris comment:**

>_This plugs back in remarks on cognitive, communication, behavior etc issues for AALE Agent gone rogue with apparent authority, that affects Principal’s liability & Estoppel._

# Second part of Berkeley's reader

**Chris comment:**

>_Some remarks suggested by second part “The Unauthorized Agent – Perspective from European and Comparative Law”: this really is a great piece of work, and, not that it’s news, but indeed one-size-fits-all legal frameworks may not fully work even with borderless online AALEs, in case they have to connect back to Earth-based local jurisdictions, which most of the time they do. However it should be possible to find some common ground on legal characteristics, that sort of cut across many disparate and fragmented jurisdictions, that is sufficient to sort out basic functions and B/L/T/ mechanism design for AALE/DAOs. _

>_In particular the author is absolutely spot on, with regard to the fact that things work rather differently in Civil Law countries, such as EU countries, in particular France. Civil Law countries do not recognize the concept of Estoppel for ex. Another country of interest is Japan, whose legal system has evolved through various influences in past thousands of years._

## 6 Inherent agency power

Restatement (Second), in an innovation from the first Restatement, identified an additional basis on which the legal consequences of an agent's action might be attributed to the principal. Restatement (Second) characterised this basis as “inherent agency power,” defining it as “the power of an agent which is derived not from authority, apparent authority or estoppel, but solely from the agency relation and exists for the protection of persons harmed by or dealing with a servant or other agent.”  The situations in which inherent agency power applied distinctively fell into two very different categories. First, and most frequently, inherent agency power was “the power of a servant to subject his employer to liability for faulty conduct in performing his master's business.”  Second, inherent agency power was the basis on which an agent might bind a principal in a transaction for which the agent lacked actual authority when the agent's 
  
## [p. 239]

departure from authorised action was only a matter of slippage from the scope of authorised action on the part of a general agent;  when the agent, acting solely in the agent's own interests, entered into a transaction that would bind the principal were the agent's motives proper; and when the agent, authorised to dispose of goods owned by the principal, departed from the authorised disposal method.

	An initial difficulty with inherent agency power is that it appears motivated by an attempt to bridge legal consequences stemming from very different bodies of primary law. That is, the rationales and policy justifications for imposing tort liability differ from rationales and policy justifications applicable in transactional settings. As a category-spanning bridge, inherent agency power seemed more like an artefact of an abstract scheme of classification than a normative doctrine articulating elements requisite to the imposition of liability.  A further difficulty stemmed from the possibility that an agent's unauthorised action might, if seen as an instance of inherent agency power, subject a principal to liability on a transaction when the third party with whom the agent dealt had notice that the agent lacked authority. To be sure, more specific formulations in Restatement (Second) appear alert to the need to fore close this risk  but inherent agency power as a freestanding doctrine always had the potential to range more widely and to provoke the imposition of liability when unwarranted by the circumstances.
	
	Restatement (Third) jettisons inherent agency power as a basis on which to subject a principal to liability. Its ability to do so stems in part from a recognition that the bridging function assigned to inherent agency power was too heroic to be useful. Thus, the circumstances under which a principal is subject to vicarious liability for torts committed by an employee 

## [p. 240]

or other agent are articulated and justified on their own terms. The circumstances under which unauthorised transactions entered into by an agent should generate legal consequences for the principal are articulated using the previously described normative vocabulary of apparent authority, estoppel and ratification. No gap in liability should result that would require or justify resort to inherent agency power.

In one rare recent instance in which the outcome reached by the court turns explicitly on inherent agency power, the result is problematic because it operates in favour of a third party that proceeded with a transaction on notice that the agent lacked actual authority to bind the principal. In Menard Inc. v. Dage/MTI, the third party dealt with a corporation through its president.  Although the third party knew that the president had required specific authorisation from the board of directors to commit the corporation to prior comparable transactions, it entered into a real estate transaction although the president lacked such authorisation and although the third party had no notice of any circumstance suggesting that the corporation had augmented the scope of its president's authority. A majority of the court acknowledged that the president lacked either actual or apparent authority to bind the corporation to the transaction but nonetheless subjected the corporation to liability on the basis of the president's inherent agency power. 

Effectively, the court's analysis in Menard allocates to a principal an ongoing burden of informing third parties with whom an agent deals that the principal has not removed restrictions on the agent's authority already known to the third party. But so to charge the principal is in sharp tension with a well-settled agency doctrine and the widely shared intuitions that underlie it. It is well established that an agent's apparent authority may survive or linger after the termination of actual authority because a third party may reasonably believe that the agent is authorised to take action and the belief is traceable to a manifestation made by the principal.  The underlying intuition is that one may reasonably assume

## [p. 241]

an agent's actual authority to be an ongoing or continuing circumstance until placed on notice of circumstances to the contrary. It is difficult to see why comparable reasoning should not apply to restrictions on an agent's authority known to a third party.

Apparent Authority
 
FRANCIS REYNOLDS•

•	Francis Reynolds is an Emeritus Professor of Law; QC, FBA.
Abstract: This essay discusses the topic of what common lawyers call 'apparent authority', whereby a principal may be bound by an unauthorized act because the agent appears to the third party to be authorized. Other legal systems reach similar (but not always identical) results, sometimes by different means. It contrasts the view taken by most legal systems that the principal's liability depends on his own conduct (or 'manifestation'), with the diametrically opposed view that the liability depends on the reasonableness of the impression received by the third party, and whether there is any intermediate position. It considers the technical means for giving effect to such approaches, especially the first, and whether the 'estoppel' approach of Anglo-Australasian common law is prefer­ able to the approach of Restatement, Third, which treats apparent authority as simply another form of authority not requiring additional means to be made effective.

1.  Introduction

The topic of (what common lawyers call) apparent authority (also called 'ostensible authority') is a central one to all accounts of a law of agency. It is not difficult to say that if one person authorizes another to act on his behalf, that person has authority to do so and may in so doing change the legal position of his principal in some way. But in real life, people deal also with persons who say they represent, purport to represent, or look as if they represent, others. These persons may in fact not have been authorized by their supposed principal. Those who so deal may require protection against this, and common law 'apparent authority' is a general notion that the third party may be entitled to invoke for his protection in such a situation. Under orthodox doctrine, the principal may be liable on the contract, for the full performance interest, despite the fact that the agent has never been given authority, would normally have authority but the authority had in fact been limited or withdrawn, or has authority but, for some reason (whether death, mental incapability or simply direct withdrawal), the authority has been terminated. But we may note immediately that in parallel situations under some other legal systems, the reliance interest only may be available, at least in some situations.

In common law, and it seems in some other countries (of those discussed in this book, Scotland and South Africa), the notion of apparent authority is a general one and stands for almost all such protection. It has to do a great deal of work. But a first point brought out by this is that in many systems, there is another possible starting point or points, and this has the result that apparent authority (or equivalent reasoning) may only need to play a less prominent role. There may be rules in some countries (Germany and the Netherlands for a start) whereby persons in a particular position (e.g., shop assistants, persons holding a document conferring general powers such as a common lawyer would call a power of attorney, and agents pursuing functions that require registration) are deemed to have certain authority, and the consequent powers of the agent may sometimes even exist although the third party knows that the principal has not authorized the act in question. There may also be special rules pro­ longing authority after it would normally have ceased. An aggregation of such rules, together with special rules for corporate agents, may in some systems leave less need for a general doctrine of apparent authority, which may indeed in some legal systems still be controversial and not completely settled. (An example may be German law.)

2.	General Doctrine of Apparent Authority: The Two Possibilities

Where there is a general doctrine of apparent authority, it has to be decided what its juristic basis is. It seems to me that this is a somewhat intractable problem in many countries, and reading the present book, I am not at all clear that the English language phrase 'apparent authority' really refers to entirely the same phenomenon in all the countries in connection with which the topic is discussed. But logically, there are two possibilities. The authority may in some way be regarded as emanating from the conduct of the principal or be attributed directly to protection of the agent.

There can be no question, but that in Western law, the first view predominates. The reason the principal is liable is that he has done something which enables the agent to appear authorized. That 'something' may be quite limited - for example, paying bills for items received or accepting or at any rate tolerating work done or, more significant commercially, appointing the agent to a position that would normally carry certain authority1 (which, to some extent, approaches rules that, in some systems, confer authority on specific types of representative, which I have mentioned above). But it is to the principal having acted in certain ways that that the agent's power, and the consequent protection of the third party, is traced.
One can see what the contrasting approach must be. It would require concentration on the good faith and reasonable belief of the third party. But there seems no hand rail for use in linking those factors. It does not seem practical to

1	Sometimes called 'usual authority'

advance a rule that any citizen who deals with another is entitled to assume that the other person, if dealing for a third party, has authority to bind the third party - even if one adds a requirement that the transaction should be a valid one. For a start, one would normally confine protection to citizens who had some reason to believe that the agent acted for another; otherwise, the reasoning would extend to undisclosed principals, and although the common law accepts this (although has never properly analyzed the relevant doctrine), it is not accepted everywhere. Second, one expects, even if the agency is disclosed, something basic linking the principal with what happened - even simply that the principal chose to act by means of an agent.

One is put in mind of similar questions arising in the transfer  of property by non-owners. In this area of property, common law starts from the contrary principle of security of title but, by means of exceptions to it, gives some rather specific protection in such situations - most notably where a 'mercantile agent' is entrusted with possession of goods. But even in this context, common law looks on how the principal had behaved. There would be no protection for the third party unless the principal had allowed the possession in certain ways - if the agent was a dealer, by giving him possession in what appeared to be his line of business, but not if he sim­ ply left the goods with the dealer for storage.

Many legal systems place emphasis on the reciprocal principle of security of title and contain general provisions protecting persons who acquire possession of goods in good faith in what reasonably appears to be a valid transaction. But where possession has been transferred, there is more to go on, more of a hand rail, than there is in the case of an unauthorized agent. The law can look on the transfer of possession itself and acquisition in a valid transaction, and there may be further restrictions, for example, non-operation where the goods had been stolen (or even lost). These do not translate across into an agency context.

3.	The Doctrinal Approach Used by Common Law

The common law is an example of a system that undoubtedly bases apparent authority on an act of the principal. Restatement, Third, Agency 2 requires a manifestation by the principal to the third party, where the third party reasonably believes the agent to be authorized and that belief is traceable to the manifestation. Those last words are extremely important to indicate the basic theory adopted. They have some echoes in ideas mentioned in the present book that link the initial conduct with some form of 'risk principle'. For English law, a textbook on agency speaks of the principal by words or conduct representing to the third party that the agent was authorized.3 The word 'represent' is also used in the leading common law case on the doctrine.4 It gives a formulation that is perhaps too strong, that is, seems to require too much, and the most recent edition has been modified to accept the Restatement's word 'manifestation', which has a more objective ring. In fact, in accordance with the ways of English judges, judicial support for the word 'represent' has recently been reiterated.5 Nevertheless, it is difficult to see that the difference matters much.

How is the manifestation (or representation) made? As already stated, it is by words, by conduct, or by allowing the supposed agent to adopt a certain position that

normally carries with it a certain authority. A difficulty of the last category is that the third party may not know what sort of authority the post normally carries. A case in which such reasoning was followed to an extreme length is one where a person was appointed an insurance 'branch manager'. The third party actually made inquiries about his authority and was given soft answers. But because the authority claimed was not that which such a manager would normally have (indeed there was no such title in the firm), the third party was held by the House of Lords unable to sue, even though he had no knowledge of the true situation and, though he had tried, no means of knowing either.6 I give this case simply as an example of how a tribunal can take logical reasoning too far and reach harsh results. I doubt whether, even with a system of binding precedent, English law is stuck with it.

4.	Refinements

It is an essential consequence of the common law reasoning that the agent's power is traced back to the conduct of the principal and that the agent alone cannot give himself authority, and this is often stated. However, exceptions are going to be recognized. The agent may not be authorized to give himself authority, but he may have authority to state facts from which legal conclusions can be drawn. Thus, in one case, the manager of a bank had no authority to grant a particular loan and was known by the third party not to have it, but he did have authority to state whether the prospective borrower's application had been approved by the head office. Hence, the bank was liable for the loan when the manager wrongly stated that the loan had been approved.7

A much less straightforward example occurs where the statement by the agent is more casual. For example, a salesman agrees on a sale on certain terms, this is queried by the purchaser, and the salesman makes a telephone call, after which he claims that he has been authorized. Can the third party rely on this? Probably not, although one wonders what more he could have done. As a colleague said to me at a seminar discussing this sort of point, 'one doesn't ask further: it's rude'. But in a commercial setting, a chartering manager known not to have authority to execute an unusual charterparty stopped the taxi with his counterparty inside, went in to get permission from his superiors, and came out and said, 'As I thought, I got it'. The principal was not bound.ll

Furthermore, although related, reasoning is required when the third party knows that the agent would have authority in certain circumstances and the agent wrongly indicates that those circumstances are operative. Two English cases concern

solicitors. In one case, the solicitor would normally have authority to promise to pay funds to a bank if his firm had already received such funds. The bank made a loan, but the firm had not received such funds. There was no express statement by the solicitor that it had, but the firm was held liable to the bank.9 In another case, payment of funds by a firm would only be authorized if it was in the normal course of business. The agent, who was a partner in the solicitors' firm, specifically stated in the relevant document that it was. The third party made no further inquiry, but when things went wrong, it was held that the solicitors' firm was not bound, and hence, the loss was to be suffered by the innocent third party. 10 The judgments contain much discussion of whether an assurance given by a solicitor has a superior standing from one given by, say, a person in the commercial world - a point that appears in examples from other countries given in the present book.

5.	Duty of lnquiry

All this raises a general question, highly relevant in a comparative context, as to the extent to which a third party ought to make inquiries. If the UNIDROIT Principles of International Commercial Contracts (PICC) are anything to go by, 11 some countries simply use formulae (in the appropriate language) translatable as something like 'knows or ought to know'. 12 This presumably puts the matter within the discretion of the judge. The Principles of European Contract Law (PECL)13 use the words 'or could not have been unaware', which seem to impose a lesser duty of inquiry. Common lawyers (especially because knowledge is a very significant feature in equity) are accustomed to having more guidance than such vague phrases. In one famous case, the judge isolated seven different degrees of knowledge, 14 and although a later court said that these were 'best forgotten', 15 there is no doubt that common lawyers (including myself) still find them useful. It looks to be the case that only French law gets near to addressing this question head-on.

6.	Relevance of Negligence

Under reasoning such as this, the idea of negligence is irrelevant to the general principle (although it may be regarded, or may once have been regarded, as relevant in some countries). It is no defence to the principal that he used every reasonable effort to prevent his agents from misbehaving themselves. If the manifestation can

be traced to the principal, and the third party acted reasonably, the principal is liable whatever steps he took.

Negligence can, however, at least in common law, come in as a separate line of reasoning where there is no agency manifestation, but it can be said that the principal has been negligent in allowing the person concerned to appear to have certain powers. An amusing example well known in American law schools, at least in former years, is the case mentioned by Professor DeMott of the bogus salesman of distinguished appearance (greying hair) carrying a clipboard, who takes an order in a shop and accepts payment for it from an imprudent customer. He is never seen again. The shop has (probably) not manifested that the grey-haired man has such agency powers, but it may be that the business of the shop is operated negligently in that insufficient precautions are taken to prevent the occurrence of such impostures. 16 Moving to a more commercial context, in Australia, a documentary credits manager signed a guarantee against delivery of goods without bill of lading, which she had no authority, actual or apparent, to do at all. She did, however, have the bank's rubber stamp, and it was held that the bank had (presumably by negligence) allowed her to give the impression that she had authority and hence was liable. 17

7.	A contrasting Picture in French Law

To all this, the response of French  (and to some extent Belgian) law, as explained in this book, seems an immense contrast. Here the concentration appears to be on the third party, what he might reasonably know, specifically, what inquiries he might reasonably be expected to make and so forth - in fact, all the points with which a doctrine that bases apparent authority on a manifestation or representation by the principal has difficulties, as I have described above. A specific internal feature is the notion that a belief must be legitimate, which introduces a new idea into the equation. Pragmatic as this is, what I find difficult to determine is the juristic basis of the principal's liability - perhaps because one instinctively feels that no one should be held liable unless there is some justification in their conduct for imposing liability on them (which is true of course of contract generally). It is said in the book that the reasoning is based on the doctrine of l'apparence, which is described as doctrine 'whereby the French courts will attach legal consequences to a person's erroneous perception of reality'. I am told that much of the developed doctrine comes from decisions of lower courts on the facts. The extent that the Cour de cassation will exercise control in order to require precise reasoning and logical consistency, and perhaps even require the application of some sort of touchstone of reasonableness, is obviously important under this technique; 18 it requires an understanding of French legal method going considerably beyond substantive law solutions.

8.	Compromise Views19

For Dutch law, Dr Busch refers to apparent authority as resting 'upon the principle of the protection of reasonable beliefs'. 20 But he follows this by saying that 'a reason­ able belief... must have been created by the principal of his own doing', which gets us back to the relevance of the conduct of the principal. It seems that due to the lack of a firm freestanding principle of justifiable reliance in the abstract, it is difficult to avoid the conduct of the principal as a starting point even if the doctrine arising is then severely modified, for example, by elements of a risk principle. As Dr Busch and Ms Macgregor say, 'No legal system appears to have rejected the connection with the principal's conduct entirely,'21

A view that I remember put forward by Professor Eisenberg at an early meeting in connection with Restatement, Third, Agency is that (if I understood him correctly) the act of the principal in acting by means of someone else was itself sufficient for imposing liability. Of course at that point, one seeks immediately to determine what a decision to act by means of another signifies.

In their 'Comparative Conclusions',22 however, Dr Busch and Ms Macgregor seem to take the view that the balancing of views is best handled as a matter of giving discretion to the court. Common lawyers would find this difficult because they regard the word 'discretion' as indicating a free choice within set limits. It was one of the early criticisms of Hart's Concept of Law that its description of the legal process made it seem to turn in the end on discretion of this sort, hence the beginning of the first attack by Dworkin. Common lawyers at any rate seek more guidance from the law.

9.	Justifications of the Principal-based Rule: The Estoppel Variant

If one sticks to the approach that traces back a manifestation to the principal, the next thing is to consider what basic theory governs the principal's subsequent liability. Here, in common law countries, the reasoning is normally attributed to estoppel,
 
19	At the meeting at which this paper was presented, it was suggested that the German approach, involving use of the doctrine of culpa in contrahendo, might represent a position between the two extremes. It is certainly a different approach but is presumably based on its own rather special starting points, and it seems to me that using a residual principle to give negative interest damages only is so different from the two extremes discussed above, which of course treat the act as authorized or as unauthorized, that one can only say that it is a separate way of viewing agency phenomena.

22	Chapter 14.

that is, a loose principle that someone who makes a statement (here as to an agent's authority, although often very indirectly made) may in certain circumstances not go back on it. The force of this reasoning is well picked up by the Scottish phrase 'personal bar', which stresses that the bar is only against a particular person who is barred from disavowing his actions, but the idea of estoppel brings in jurisprudence and doctrine of an extensive nature. The consequence of adopting such reasoning is that the doctrine may only be used to fix the principal with liability; Dr Busch refers more than once23 to the idea that the third party is entitled but not bound to take advantage of this reasoning. He cannot actually sue unless he ratifies. This is a comparatively minor matter, but not without consequences, as I shall explain.

For, at any rate, some forms of common law, it can be said to be an estoppel not entirely in accord with the general principles of the notion as they are tradition­ ally formulated in some contexts, for these require specific reliance on a representation, and apparent authority is plainly a looser notion. I admit to various vacillations on this point, but I personally now think the correct approach is stated in a recent book on estoppel in which the writer, Mr Justice Handley of the Court of Appeal of New South Wales, says, 'Each form of estoppel has its own elements, although some are common to others. The similarities warrant their recognition as a form of estoppel, but the differences make each a distinct form with its own history and requirements'. 24 I think this must be correct.

10.	Second Basis: Objective Interpretation of Contract

If, however, apparent authority is not to be based on estoppel, we must find another basis for it. The obvious alternative is the reasoning provided by the rules relating to formation of contract, which in common law countries at any rate is very clearly objective. You are bound because you gave the impression to the other party, in a way that was reasonable to be relied on, that you intended to be bound. Agency merely complicates the situation; you are bound because you gave that impression by means of an agent. But equally, the third party who deals with an agent on this basis intends to be bound to the principal. So apparent authority is just another form of authority and justifies the principal's suing as well as his liability to be sued. Ratification is not necessary. 25

This seems to be the approach of the PECL26 (although I have never been convinced that it is what was originally meant). Itis in fact much clearer in the Draft
 
23 For example, 142-143.

24 Estoppel by Conduct and Election (2006), para. 1-028.

25	My colleague, Dr Krebs, who takes this view, has recently shown {inter alia) that a failure to see differences between these types of reasoning creates some unsatisfactory results in the Ratification section. See 'Harmonisation and how not to do it: agency in the UNIDROIT Principles of International Commercial Contracts 2004', (2009] LMCLQ 57.

26	Article 3:201.

Common Frame of Reference (DCFR).27 More significantly, Restatement, Third also treats apparent authority as simply another form of authority, not only fixing liability on the principal but also allowing him to sue without ratifying. This gratifies any desire there may be for a tidy system that does not have to be corrected by any imprecise doctrine of estoppel and enables Restatement, Third to isolate a function for (what we may call) 'true' estoppel, where representation and reliance as required by orthodox doctrine can be seen. That can be used on the edges of normal apparent authority reasoning, as where there is no authority, actual or apparent, but the sup­ posed principal allows it to appear that there had been authority, or knowing that the third party had assumed that there was authority when there was not, he took no steps to correct the misapprehension. 28

It appears that a proposal to adopt this second, objective approach was actually made (by Professor Lando himself) to the compilers of the PICC but rejected on the basis that ratification would be easy anyway. I personally find the idea that apparent authority is simply another type of authority, arising from the principal's manifestation to the third party as opposed to the agent, difficult to accept. It means that the normal safeguards against unfair ratification are not applicable. It also means, so far as I can see, that the principal who has not authorized an act can nevertheless sue on it if he proves that the third party was in a position to take advantage of the doctrine of apparent authority whether the third party wants to do so or not - an odd proposition. As I say in this book, only one case is cited in the Restatement as authority for such reasoning, and it does not seem to me one that could not have been solved in a different way.29 In my view, treating apparent authority as carrying with it the principal's right to sue is not necessary or appropriate, and that of course casts doubt in general on the 'interpretation of contract' justification for apparent authority.

11.	Tailpiece: Termination of Authority

One area in which common law, at any rate outside the United States, may well be behind the game is the effect of the death or incapacity of the principal on the agent's authority. There are few cases in England on the point, but as between principal and agent, the position seems to be still that death or incapacity of the principal removes the agent's authority whether the third party knew of it or not. The position taken by Restatement, Third that the internal authority continues until the agent learns or ought reasonably to have learned of the event is clearly preferable

to modern eyes but would be difficult to achieve except by legislation. It would facilitate solution of the external situation also. Without such reasoning, in the area of apparent authority, it could still be argued that the principal had been removed from the scene, thus displacing apparent authority reasoning. There are now some quite vigorous judicial statements in England that apparent authority nevertheless continues.30 The matter, however, is not easy to solve by sweeping rules, for there are here two competing claimants for protection: the third party who has reason­ ably relied, and the estate or property of the deceased person or the person who has become mentally incapable. The protection of the third party may not so obviously take preference in all situations; more detailed nuancing may be required. Rather similar problems arise in the case of insolvency. There is in England a small amount of rather complicated statutory protection relating to formal documents conferring authority (powers of attorney), dating back to the alarm caused by the decision first imposing strict liability on afalsus procurator in 1857.31 The whole question needs tidying up in England, although other common law countries may be more fortunate in this respect. But this is not an area in which law reform wins the votes of the electorate.

12.	Overview

In 1969, a very well-known English judge (and jurist) said, 'It may be that some wider conception of vicarious responsibility other than that of agency, as normally understood, may have to be recognized in order to accommodate some of the more elaborate cases which now arise when there are two persons who become mutually involved or associated in one side of a transaction.' 32 Forty years later, this has not happened (I note that he gave no indication as to what the wider conception might be) and we are still wrestling with the same problems. Analogies with vicarious liability for torts have in England become less likely to be thought suitable because of recent changes in the reasoning used in tort in some common law countries.

So, as far as I can see, all legal systems tangle, in the law of agency or representation, with complexities of theory that have not yet found a generally acceptable solution, but (as so often  in comparative law) the results are much the same whatever the reasoning used. The similarity between the accounts given in the present book is in fact very striking; the problems set by the cases and the considerations taken into account in answering them are the same in all countries, and slight differences in doctrine (if there are such) make little difference in result. By whatever technique, legal systems judge situations in the same ways. The editors'  'Comparative Law Evaluation' 33

sometimes suggests that common law adjusts toward the continental position (whatever that may be) or even towards the PECL or PICC (however that could be achieved). I see little opportunity and little need for this. Judges in all countries deploy rules of apparent authority or their equivalent to give appropriate solutions, and I do not know of any common law decision (outside some outdated reasoning used in the nineteenth and very early twentieth centuries, when the doctrine of apparent authority had not been fully worked out34) where common law doctrinal problems demanded an inappropriate result. Estoppel, and its possible requirement of 'detrimental reliance', which is represented as being a problem in common law, has not caused difficulty, and the analysis of Mr Justice Handley explains why, although it looks as if some of the technicalities of estoppel may have proved more significant in South Africa. But it is in any case not easy to see how the great corpus of reasoning that surrounds the common law notion of estoppel could or should easily be eradicated.

In all of this a fresh code-like production such as Restatement, Third enables the adoption of cleaner reasoning in common law. (The difficulty with PECL and PICC is that they are too terse and neither is sufficiently motive to indicate the theory (if any) behind them.35 ) But it is still difficult to see much difference of result. As Dr Busch and Ms Macgregor say36 'Each legal system attempts to carry out a type of uneasy compromise', and that is the overall picture which in my view emerges from this book.
 
34 A dramatic example was Grant v. Norway (1861) 10 CB 665, concerning signature of a bill of lading for goods not on board. A key decision in the evolution of the doctrine is Hambro v. Burnand (1904] 2 KB 10.
