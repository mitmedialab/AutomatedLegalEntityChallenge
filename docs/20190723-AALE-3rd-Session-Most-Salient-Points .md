## Law ReImagined-
## Inventing Automated and Autonomous Legal Entities Part 3

### "AALE" Collaborative Hack with Dazza, Beth, Brenden, Bryan, Silke et al. 

###

### Most salient points from the July 23rd 2019 3rd Live Session
#### (from Berlin, directed by Beth in collaboration with Cem & Jim from Publishing DAO)
 
#

##### Chris B. DRAFT Unverified – this work is consistently built upon input from above Team Legal Hackers Extraordinaire, thus mistakes, confusions & omissions are ours (non-lawyer Chris) only.

#

#### -A- Suggestion for better process by Bryan

##### Approved & being implemented (including this data migration to Github):

#

**_“ As a process for ensuring that each working session has something produced from it - insights, concerns identified - it would be good to:_**

**- 1) include a summary of the goals in the call that is laid out ahead of time,**

**- 2) materials involved to produce the session, and**

**- 3) a feedback loop that takes in the information from the call and generates a summary from it.**

_**So that the insights are crystallized in a usable, chronological form. “**_

#

##### Furthermore, bearing in mind some of the ulterior motives are educational, and also advising senior decision makers in various settings, it’s important to keep it all intelligible, digestible & palatable.

#

#### -B- Engagement with customer and laying the ground to establish a lawyer-client relationship by first making sure the user better understands the Legal analysis approach of what they do on daily basis with a Business & Technological mindset.

While none of this is Legal Advice, nor may be construed as (an attempt at) Legal Practice, the ones in a position to expect from this some form of usefulness & utility, include user Publishing DAO: user is in a position to assess the usability of this work when user can complete their Business & Technological polyvalent setup with a Legal-analysis-oriented approach. 

There is a difference between Technological and Legal definitions of Roles and Relationships, and therefore Legal assessment of Rights and Responsibilities (R4). For ex., depending on context, user Publishing DAO can be an Agent (of a writer acting as Principal) or Publishing DAO can be a Principal, with logistics company acting as Agent. This has severe enough legal & liability consequences to pay attention to. 

It also suggests that when Agency Law isnt sufficient to tackle most of the scenarios, it becomes necessary to switch to Contract Law (and Tort etc.) which implies to build a series of disclaimers in order to shield the Publishing DAO from basic legal harm that can be dodged. The nature of the legal structure behind the legal persons involved, and the degree of automation & autonomy also affect the lawyer-client relationship establishment, process & procedures.

#

#### -C- Start with simplified use cases and build a primary foundation – then build up complexity. 

Freeze patterns of possible scenarios that happen, then determine R4 and proceed to legal analysis under any type of Law.

#

#### -D- Taming the troika of complexity, granularity, and guaranteed rabbit holes.

Here we use certain selective methods to tame the troika of complexity, granularity, and guaranteed rabbit holes, while not losing sight of the larger picture, and ultimate usefulness & utility of this work & project, starting with convergence toward defining a B/L/T/ mechanism design.

#

#### -E- (Re-)Statement of objectives

##

##### -E-1: Pre-Fall objectives (Working Topics as laid out by Dazza in GitHub)

**Quote:**

**“Starting with the basic agency law analysis conducted during our prior session focused on the roles, relationships, rights and responsibilities of the Principal, Agent and Third Party in the three scenarios involving the sale of a book, as a next step we ask:**_

**• What are the issues, options and opportunities presented when one of the Actors in each scenario is itself a DAO or other type of automated and autonomous legal entity?**

**• Specifically, what issues, options and opportunities arise with respect to the legal concepts:**

-o Binding Assent to Agency Relationship and Contract Formation (lots of open questions)

-o Scope and Type of Authority (addressed above and more questions identified)

-o Estoppel and Detrimental reliance (addressed above and more questions identified)

_**How can an automated system be constructed such that at any given point in time the relevant roles / relationships and rights / responsibilities, and hence most probably legal outcomes, can be assessed at any moment in the transaction or workflow etc.**_

**Note: a very well B/L/T/ engineered system should afford this type of monitoring and reporting "out-of-the-box".** “

**Unquote.**

##### -E-2: AALE/DAO engineered for self-compliance among members and vis-à-vis external parties

_**Risk management measures** - Trustless functions organizing the human systems of AALE/DAOs within the whole ecosystem._

##

##### -E-3: "Three-Bees" Functions & Legal Objects

_These must be defined as **point of obligated passage toward building up frameworks.** See Section F-5._
 
Brenden rebounding on Silke’s thoughts of engineering much by contract:

_**“At some point we will come to understand how the bodies of Law meet {computationally}.”**_

#

#### -F- A Question of Method(s) in Legal Analysis

##

##

##### -F-1: Apply several legal frameworks & define R4 (Roles & Relationships, Rights & Responsibilities)

##

##### -F-2: Merits of Agency Law framework

Including when to realize that an Agency Law analysis does NOT apply: 

ClickThrough Agreement DAO:Agency “We are not your agent if we do nothing”.

No action or agency relationship: it is extremely important that users understand there is no agency relationship if something is put forth as a vote, because if it is NOT accepted by the (Publishing) DAO, the (Publishing) DAO should be able to drop it as it is non-binding and not executable under an Agency Law relationship. Disclaimer advised: DAO may say yes, no, or do nothing.

##

##### -F-3: Merits of Contract Law framework (+ some Tort Law maybe)

Agency Law vs. Contract law: Contract law disclaimers for functions(Bryan and Silke)

Much can be done with Contract Law, the question is if things fall through the cracks how does agency law catch that.

##

##### -F-4: Dichotomy between traditional set-up & AALE/DAO in relation with Legal Structures

##

##

##### -F-5: "Three-Bees" Functions and Legal Objects that are required to build up frameworks toward objectives

>• **“ if business type is A, if roles are configured X, the function involved is Y, then outcome is Z “**

Brenden rebounding on Silke’s thoughts of engineering much by contract:

**“At some point we will come to understand how the bodies of Law meet {computationally}.”**    

#####

We call these **"Three-Bees" Functions & Legal Objects "** _(**"Three-Bees"** stands for Beth, Bryan, Brenden- et al.)_ 

#####

_**The Functions are instrumental to shield the DAO from legal harm at a minimum via disclaimers- important!!**_

**Functions - Bryan:**
>Once we started identifying which functions produce which kind of outcomes, we can start coming up with a standard set of disclaimers that can be used for that series of functions. So if it's functions related to the voting mechanism or functions related to if it's the way the DAO meaning takes place, you can start coming up with templates that are specifically meant for DAO such that they're keeping the liability at a minimum. (Dazza: Amen- Beth: Definitely-).

**Legal Objects - Bryan:**
>Just quickly I think the construction that we used in having all of these roles and functions and maps denoted by shapes and relationships is that what we are really moving into this Legal Object model where each different piece of the puzzle has different attributes that are based on not just where it's positioned but also the specific features that it holds and those features can help- those features will necessarily impact what the legal ramifications are in the event of any of these scenarios that we've gone through.

##

##### -F-6: Guaranteed Rabbit Hole 1- capped & to be tackled later: differences between jurisdictions

(What are the rights and responsibilities of an espresso book machine in different jurisdictions.)

Ultimately mapping Law & different kinds of law: Agency law, Contract law, Tort Law, Securities Law.

##

##### -F-7: Guaranteed Rabbit Hole 2- capped & to be tackled later: code, free speech, and liability

Code executed can be evil but code not executed is just text per se. Then comes the chain of events & liabilities.

#

#### -G- Other important points requiring further digging  

##

##### G-1 Fault Tolerance

**Fault Tolerance:** if the output (of a transaction) is gibberish, how do you account for that.

**Fault Tolerance:** there can also be timing issues and financing issues where you can’t roll things backwards.

##

##### G-2 Computational Law outcomes 

Need to collect DAO or Computational systems features that have legal consequence for outcomes in different kinds of law-

E.G.

1. Autonomous process versus human in the loop

2. Reputation bounty

3. Token manager versus voting machine

##

##### G-3 Bonding Curve

The bonding curve has different roles and responsibilities and actors at different points along the curve.

##

##### G-4 Staking

If many different kinds of staking- what could go wrong.

##

##### G-5 Voting

Voting without knowledge of wrongdoing- what are the implications under which Law.
